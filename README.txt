ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project introduces an immersive odyssey-style game inspired by the world of Greek mythology. Players embark on a journey 
as a hero traversing through mythical landscapes, encountering gods, monsters, and legendary beings. Along the way, they must
solve puzzles, overcome challenges, and make strategic choices that impact the outcome of their quest. The ultimate goal is
to complete the Odyssey and reach the Ithica.
